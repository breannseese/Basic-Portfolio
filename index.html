				<img class="headshot" src="Picture of  Me.jpg" alt="Breann Seese" >Hello, there! Thanks for visiting my page. Here are some things about me I want to share with you!
			</p>
			<p>I have been working in the healthcare industry for the past 3 years and have decided to make a big career change. I am in the process of learning web developement and I am loving it! Although it is challenging, I am very excited to gain the skills needed to get a new job.
		 
			</p>
			<p>
				I spend a lot of time between work and school but I still find time for my hobbies! I love reading, going on walks and playing with my cat Phoebe.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think my favorite hobby of all is spending time with my family. We love going to the movies, cooking together and we always try to go on trips whenever possible. We are also very excited to meet our newest addition to the family arriving in May!
